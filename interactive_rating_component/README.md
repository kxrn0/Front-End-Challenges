## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I practiced the use of async code, as well as graceful error handling when there is a network problem.

### Continued development

I would like to add a loding spinner for when the connection is slow, however for now I'l consider this project completed.
